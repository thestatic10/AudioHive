# SpotifyService.kt Change Log

## 2024-12-19 - Authentication Fix
**Time:** Current session  
**Changes Made:**
1. **Fixed hardcoded credential validation**: Removed incorrect check that was flagging real Spotify CLIENT_ID "1454f53a7e7d45ec84b60995a30f1873" as a placeholder
2. **Restored real credentials**: Put back the user's actual Spotify app credentials
3. **Simplified error handling**: Removed the problematic conditional check in `exchangeCodeForToken()` method that was causing "Please setup real spotify credentials" error

**Issue Resolved:** 
- User was getting "authentication failed - please setup real spotify credentials" error even with valid credentials
- This was caused by a hardcoded check that incorrectly assumed their real CLIENT_ID was a placeholder

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/groupmusicplayer/services/SpotifyService.kt`
  - Lines 12-13: Restored real CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET values
  - Lines 96-100: Removed hardcoded placeholder check in error handling

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Verify Redirect URI in Spotify dashboard: `com.groupmusicplayer://callback`
2. Check if Spotify app is in Development Mode and add user email to access list
3. Test authentication again to see actual error messages

## 2024-12-19 - Duplicate Authorization Code Fix
**Time:** Current session  
**Changes Made:**
1. **Fixed duplicate authorization code processing**: Modified `handleSpotifyCallback()` in both MainActivity.kt and MusicPlayerActivity.kt to clear `intent.data` immediately after processing to prevent the same authorization code from being processed multiple times
2. **Root cause identified**: Android logs showed duplicate simultaneous token exchange requests, causing "invalid_client" errors because Spotify authorization codes can only be used once
3. **Solution**: Clear intent data immediately when processing authorization code to prevent duplicate requests

**Issue Resolved:** 
- User was getting "invalid_client" error due to duplicate processing of the same authorization code
- The same callback was being processed multiple times via `onNewIntent()` and `onResume()` lifecycle methods
- Authorization codes are single-use only, so subsequent attempts after the first use would fail

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/groupmusicplayer/MainActivity.kt`
  - Lines 185, 191: Added `intent.data = null` to clear intent data after processing
- `app/src/main/java/com/groupmusicplayer/activities/MusicPlayerActivity.kt`
  - Lines 670, 676: Added `intent.data = null` to clear intent data after processing

**Expected Result:**
- Spotify authentication should now work correctly without "invalid_client" errors
- Single authorization code will be processed only once

## 2024-12-19 - Enhanced Credential Handling
**Time:** Current session  
**Changes Made:**
1. **Added detailed debug logging**: Added logs to show exactly what CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and authorization headers are being sent to Spotify
2. **Added fallback credential approach**: If Authorization header approach fails with "invalid_client", the service now tries sending client_id and client_secret in the form body instead
3. **Separated auth OkHttp client**: Created separate OkHttp client for authentication requests without authInterceptor to prevent interference
4. **Enhanced error handling**: Better logging to distinguish between different credential approaches and their results

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/groupmusicplayer/services/SpotifyService.kt`
  - Lines 83-87: Added debug logging for credential details
  - Lines 105-127: Added fallback form body credential approach
  - Lines 49-55: Created separate authOkHttpClient without authInterceptor
  - Lines 462-469: Added new SpotifyAuthApi method for form body credentials

**Troubleshooting Approach:**
- First tries Authorization header with Basic auth (standard approach)
- If that fails with "invalid_client", tries form body with client_id and client_secret fields
- Detailed logging shows exactly what's being sent to Spotify for diagnosis
