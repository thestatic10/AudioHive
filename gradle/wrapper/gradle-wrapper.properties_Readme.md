# Changelog for gradle-wrapper.properties

## Session Joining Functionality Fix - 2024-12-19 20:00:00 PST
- **Fixed missing methods in MusicPlayerActivity**:
  - Added `findSessionByRoomCode()` method to properly handle joining sessions
  - Added `rejoinSession()` method to handle rejoining previous sessions
  - Fixed method name from `startListeningToSession()` to `startListeningForUpdates()`
- **Added missing methods in FirebaseService**:
  - Added `getSessionByRoomCode()` method to retrieve session details by room code
  - Added `listenToSessionInfo()` method to listen for session info changes
- **Technical details**:
  - The app was crashing when trying to join/rejoin sessions because these methods were being called but not implemented
  - Now properly handles session lookup, joining, and real-time updates
